# How did we get here?

![left fit](assets/information-architecture-4ht-edition.jpg)

"[...] there was a time when **information** existed in a **tightly coupled relationship with the artifacts that conveyed that information**. [...] However, this particular **container** (the disc) **and the information** (the music) were **irrevocably tied together** after being manufactured."

---

# How did we get here?

![left fit](assets/information-architecture-4ht-edition.jpg)

"Going back further—to a time before mechanical reproductions— **we find an even tighter relationship between information and its containers**. Think of early **books**: [...] Because of the rarity and cost of these early books, **reading them was an activity reserved for particular classes of people** (e.g., scholars, monks, aristocrats, etc.) in specific times and places (e.g., an abbey library during daylight hours)."

# The Information

### Where is it stored? (write)
### Who transmits it? (copy)
### How is it transmitted?
### Who consumes it it?

# Content Management

![left fit](assets/web-content-management.jpg)

"**Content** is **information produced** through **editorial process** and ultimately **intended for human consumption** **via publication**."

---

# Content Management System (CMS)

![left fit](assets/web-content-management.jpg)

"A **content management system (CMS)** is a **software** package that provides some level of **automation** for the **tasks** required to effectively **manage content**."

# The Anatomy of a Content Management System (CMS)
![left](assets/Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_007.jpg)

1. Content **management**
  1. Modeling, versioning, editing, ...
  1. ACLs (who can do what) & audit (who did what when), ...
1. Content **delivery**
  1. Querying / search
  1. Templating / rendering (frameworks, libraries, ...)
  1. Analytics, personalization, SEO, ...

# Typology of Web Content Management Systems

1. Coupled vs decoupled
2. Decoupled vs headless vs API-first
3. On-premise vs Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

---

# Coupled vs decoupled

### Coupled: management and delivery on the same server
### TODO: add diagram

---

# Decoupled vs headless vs API-first

### Decoupled: management and delivery on different servers **but** CMS manages the delivery environment
### TODO: Gentics CMS is a decoupled CMS, or?

---

#  On-premise vs Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

### TODO: add pros & cons
### Marketing (external) vs IT (internal) driven projects
### Total life of the content: ephemeral (campaign websites) vs corporate website

# The Neutron Dance

![left](assets/neutron-dance.png)

1. The half-life of content is considerable higher than that of its presentation.
1. Content **editing** and content **presentation** are different concerns
1. Developers need to learn *each* CMS *APIs* and *framework*
1. Editors need to *learn* the specific CMS administration interface
1. Customers need to find developers for the implementation... every 2 years
